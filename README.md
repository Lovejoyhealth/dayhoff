# Project
## Description

## Installation
**Requirements**: 
* PyTorch: 2.2 and above
* CUDA 12.0 and above
* Optionally install Flash Attention following installation instructions here: https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention

To download our code, we recommend creating a clean conda environment with Python 3.10.16

```
conda create --name dayhoff python=3.10.16
```

In that new environment, install PyTorch, mamba-ssm, and causal-conv1d. Then install Dayhoff. Optionally, install Flash Attention 1 or 2.

```
pip install dayhoff # For bleeding edge: pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/dayhoff.git
```
### Mamba-ssm and causal-conv1d recommendations

It is sometimes challenenging to properly install these packages just using pip. The following two errors are common when simply using pip install:
* packages installed correctly, but when loading models you get "ValueError: Fast Mamba kernels are not available. Make sure to they are installed and that the mamba module is on a CUDA device."
* Package instalation of causal-conv1d or mamba-ssm fail during the build

If you encounter any of these erros, try installing using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Dao-AILab/causal-conv1d.git
cd causal-conv1d
git checkout v1.4.0 # current latest version tag
CAUSAL_CONV1D_FORCE_BUILD=TRUE pip install .
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba.git
cd mamba
git checkout v2.2.4 # current latest version tag
CAUSAL_CONV1D_FORCE_BUILD=TRUE CAUSAL_CONV1D_SKIP_CUDA_BUILD=TRUE CAUSAL_CONV1D_FORCE_CXX11_ABI=TRUE pip install --no-build-isolation .
```
